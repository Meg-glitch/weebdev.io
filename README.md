**WeebDev Game Project (Working Title)**

**Overview**
This is an open-source project initiated by the Web Dev Discord group with the goal of developing a competitive, "Tetris-like" game for 1v1 gameplay. This document outlines the high-level objectives and current progress of the project to help new contributors quickly understand the project's scope.

**Project Goals**
The primary goal of this project is to create a simple yet engaging 1v1 "Tetris-like" game that runs directly in a web browser. As the game is still in the early stages of development, it currently operates under the working title "WeebDev Game."

**Key Features**
Browser-Based Gameplay: The game will be developed using JavaScript, ensuring it is fully playable within any modern web browser.
Core Mechanics: Players will face off in a classic "Tetris" style match, where blocks descend for each player in real-time. The speed at which the blocks fall will increase progressively to intensify the challenge.
Scoreboard: An in-game scoreboard will track player scores, enhancing the competitive element.
Future Enhancements
While the current focus is on implementing the core mechanics, we have discussed additional features that could be introduced in future updates to add depth and excitement to the gameplay. These features may include power-ups, advanced scoring systems, and more intricate multiplayer functionalities.

**Stay Updated**
As development progresses, we will continue to update this document with new features, enhancements, and other important information. Stay tuned for more updates and contribute your ideas to help us build an exciting and competitive game!
